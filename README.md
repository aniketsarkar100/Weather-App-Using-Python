# Weather-App-Using-Python
This Weather App is a simple Python-based tool that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the free OpenWeatherMap API. It runs in the terminal and displays current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. Users just enter a city name, and the app handles the rest. It uses the requests library to make API calls and parses the JSON response.
